Alignment-Based Conserved Enhancer Search


This code is designed to take advantage of the relatively lower mutation rates of regulatory regions of the genome when compared to non-genic, non-regulatory DNA. It uses a multiple alignment and consensus sequence that it converts into a string of numbers indicating conservation. It then takes each window of 100 bp and scores its conservation.
